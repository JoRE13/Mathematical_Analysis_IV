# Numerical Project – Mathematical Analysis IV (STÆ401G)

## Description

This numerical project was completed as part of **Mathematical Analysis IV** during the spring semester of 2025.  
The project examines the **steady-state heat distribution** in a cooling plate connected to a heat-generating component, such as a processor.  
The goal is to **numerically compute** the equilibrium temperature distribution in the plate for materials with different physical properties, allowing for **graphical visualization** of the results.  

In the second part of the project, **random defects** are introduced into the cooling plate—representing realistic physical imperfections—to analyze their effect on the outcome.  

The complete project solution can be found in the accompanying **Jupyter notebook**.

For those interested in the theoretical background and mathematical methods used, further details are available in the **project report** or on the [edbook](https://edbook.hi.is/stae401g/index.html).

**Grade:** 100/100

## How to Run

To run the project:
